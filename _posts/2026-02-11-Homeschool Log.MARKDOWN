**FOCUSES**: Sleep Hygiene, Social Awareness, Reading Level Assessment, Gym, Cleanliness

Observations & Notes: 

Tirzah has spontaneously taken her dishes to the sink at least once per day multiple days this week, this was an amazing improvement and seemingly out of nowhere. Tirzah refused to collaborate on dishes, dresser building and general cleaning, but was eager to help with laundry. Already there has been really good progress. However, her sleep hygiene is horrendous. She admitted she's been just vibin'[^1] on her sleep schedule. 

[^1]: *Vibin'* is defined as adopting an extremely disorganized sleep schedule with almost no circadian or diurnal rhythm due to not feeling the need to go to sleep at a time that most of society would call "reasonable." Oftentimes, Tirzah won't sleep at all, in the hopes of "fixing her sleep." She "fixed" her sleep once, but then required a nap the next day that ended up being four hours long. 

Now even the good had a little bad mixed in. Tirzah did keep her room relatively picked up, and was really good about trash and dishes by her standards, but her cleaning often took place loudly at 3 a.m. due to her sleeping throughout the entire day. 

Tirzah is working on rational numbers and adding decimals in Khan Academy. She began the week at 15% mastery, and is now at 

Bryan and Tirzah did a reading assessment utilizing Alice in Wonderland as the book to assess her ability to read out loud and process the page. Tirzah passed with flying colors! Reading is definitely a **STRENGTH**. She not only read at an incredibly quick rate, she only paused for two words during the entire session. Once for the word bank, which she responded, "like a river?", to which I said yes. So, really she only functionally didn't know one phrase, and that phrase was an old timey colloquial one that I had never even heard. She also tied in how the Rabbit from Alice is a popular meme for her generation, noting that there is a picture of the white rabbit pointing at his timepiece- Tirzah noted that the relevance of that meme is to denote that "time is running out," or that you "forgot that time is always running." She later read a bit about the Rabbit's timepiece in the book, and said "see, like I was saying before." This instance showed not just an ability to comprehend the text, but pull sympbolic meaning out of the text. This was perhaps, academically at least, Tirzah's best moment of the week so far. 

Overall, Tirzah's attitude towards homeshchooling has been excellent, despite what the sleep hygiene may suggest. Even half-awake, she tried to make sure she was available for 10 a.m. Even if some of our session were short this first week due to the sleep deprivation making certain things difficult, it was overall a successful week. I think Tirzah satisfied my expectations for the week according to where she wants to be at the end of our homeschooling journey: *a student capable of handling the rigors and responsibilities of conventional public school.*

## MISC.

# Deschool Cleaning Procedure


1. Remove clutter – gather stray items, set them aside.
2. Dust top‑down – start at the ceiling, work toward lower surfaces.
3. Wipe all horizontals – desks, shelves, windowsills, using a damp cloth.
4. Polish glass – spray and wipe in a “Z” to avoid streaks.
5. Treat fabrics – vacuum upholstery, spot‑clean stains.
6. Floor care – vacuum carpet or sweep hardwood, then mop the latter with a lightly damp mop.
7. Trash – empty bins, replace liners.
8. Inspect – check corners, under furniture, and touch up any missed dust.
